# AI Related Introduction Projects 

**AI_Related_Introduction_Projects** by Abdelilah Eddahhaoui

A collection of AI demos and introductory experiments that I completed for the course *HarvardX: CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python*.  
Most of the code provided here was originally precompiled as part of the course, and only certain sections required modification to complete the assignments.  
As such, I do **not claim full credit** for the entire codebase—only the parts that I directly wrote or adjusted to make the projects function correctly.

## Repository Collection

This repository includes individual projects organized in separate folders. The topics covered range across several key areas of artificial intelligence, including:

- **Search algorithms**
- **Knowledge representation and logic**
- **Markov models and probability**
- **Machine learning (including Naive Bayes and neural networks)**
- **Reinforcement learning (Q-learning)**

Each project typically contains:
- Source code for the assignment.
- Instructions or a `README` explaining the goal and structure.
- A `requirements.txt` file for setting up dependencies.

## Getting Started

To explore or run any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdelilah-eddahhaoui/AI_Related_Introduction_Projects.git
   cd AI_Related_Introduction_Projects/<project-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if provided):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script (usually `runner.py`, `main.py`, or as indicated in the project README):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
